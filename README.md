# Automate Sorting your Files in a given directory
 - filetypes.txt
    - Provides the most common types of files and their types
 -  folder_sort.py
    - Using regex, os and pathlib library it dynamically filters a given directory into the folder types provided in the text file
 - This project is trivially scalable if required and it was created more as a self-help sorting mechanism.
